## Codecademy Project Prompt

### Portfolio Website

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this [Path]((https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path)). Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
