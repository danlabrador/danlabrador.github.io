        Despite resorting to low-code/no-code automations, our IT infrastructure
        in My Amazon Guy is diverse and integrated, revolving around platforms
        such as Zapier, HubSpot, Slack, and Asana. This complexity necessitates
        a well-defined process to navigate our Quality Assurance (QA) tasks
        efficiently. So, our team developed system testing procedure that is
        specifically tailored for thorough testing of integrations and
        automations in our low-code/no-code environments. Here are some key
        insights and tips from our process that can be beneficial for anyone
        looking to conduct manual testing.
